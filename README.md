# Bloomberg-2.0

Description: A simplified, but more dynamic news website where in the future, the user will be able to choose which stocks 
they want to see in the ticker, as well as a home-made stock chart table rather than using a widget in the future. The main purpose 
is to practice CSS and Bootstrap.
